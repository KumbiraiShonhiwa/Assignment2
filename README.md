# CET3012 – Data Technologies Assignment 2  
## Integrated Data Analytics & Visualisation for Coffee Haven

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 2 of the CET3012 Data Technologies module**.  
The project focuses on integrating, transforming, analysing, and visualising data from multiple business systems to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Coffee Haven** is a growing coffee chain operating:
- Physical retail stores (POS system)
- An online ordering platform (web & mobile)
- A customer loyalty programme

These systems operate in silos. The objective of this assignment is to **build an integrated data solution** using Python that enables both **strategic and tactical business insights**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Addressed

- **LO2:** Design and implement a data-driven solution using advanced data technologies to solve a real-world business problem.
- **LO3:** Integrate, analyse, and visualise data from multiple heterogeneous sources.

---
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning, transformation, and integration
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – data visualisation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – development and documentation
* **PowerPoint** – business-focused presentation of insights

---

## 📊 Task Breakdown

### ✅ Task 1: Data Integration, Transformation & Analytics

Using Python and Pandas, the following steps were performed:

* Cleaned and standardised date, text, and numeric fields
* Integrated POS, online sales, and loyalty datasets
* Created derived metrics such as revenue, visit frequency, and average spend
* Conducted exploratory and comparative analytics to answer:

  * In-store vs online sales trends by **time**, **product**, and **location**
  * Impact of the **loyalty programme** on customer spend and behaviour
  * Identification of **high-performing and underperforming products and stores**

---

### ✅ Task 2: Integrated Visualisation

Two business-focused visualisations were developed:

1. **Sales Performance Dashboard**

   * Sales by channel (POS vs Online)
   * Sales by store, product, and time

2. **Customer Behaviour Analysis**

   * Loyalty vs non-loyalty customer spend
   * Visit frequency and channel preference comparison

Visuals were designed to be:

* Scientifically accurate
* Aesthetically clear
* Accessible to non-technical stakeholders

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Online sales show distinct peak periods compared to in-store transactions
* Loyalty members demonstrate higher average spend and visit frequency
* Certain products and stores consistently outperform others, indicating areas for optimisation
* Data integration enables a unified view of customer behaviour across channels

---

## 📑 Deliverables

* ✔️ Python code with in-line documentation
* ✔️ Integrated datasets ready for analysis
* ✔️ Business-focused visualisations
* ✔️ PowerPoint presentation (≤ 12 slides) with detailed speaker notes explaining:

  * Process
  * Methodology
  * Interpretation of results
